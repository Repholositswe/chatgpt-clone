# ChatGPT Clone

This is a project aimed at creating a ChatGPT-like interface. The application allows users to interact with AI, using OpenAI's GPT model, but it's currently **incomplete** due to the following challenges:

## Current Status:

- **Configuration Error**:  
  There is an ongoing issue related to the API configuration. The code is not working as expected because of this error, which is preventing me from making successful requests to OpenAI’s API.
  
  The error is related to the `Configuration` not being correctly initialized or being incompatible with the current setup, causing the application to fail at runtime.

- **OpenAI API Limitations**:  
  The application requires an OpenAI API key to make requests and receive responses. However, due to **payment requirements** for OpenAI's API access, I cannot proceed with further development or testing at this time. OpenAI currently limits free usage, and in order to fully utilize the API, I would need to upgrade the account or use paid credits.

## Project Roadmap (Future Goals):

- **Fix Configuration Issue**:  
  Address the configuration error preventing the application from making successful requests.

- **API Integration**:  
  Once the configuration issue is resolved, I'll proceed with integrating OpenAI's API properly to retrieve responses.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**:  
  Improve the user interface and experience for a smoother chat interaction.

## How to Contribute:

If you have experience with OpenAI’s API or troubleshooting JavaScript configurations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I would appreciate any help in resolving the ongoing challenges.
